Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of identifying Ransomware attacks within network traffic.

Specifically, we focus on the detection of Zero-Day attacks (unknown threats) by analyzing the UGRansome dataset. Our system classifies network events into three categories:

Signature (S): Known attacks.

Synthetic Signature (SS): Simulated attacks.

Anomaly (A): Zero-Day / Unknown threats (Critical Target).

Our ambition is to maximize the Recall on the 'Anomaly' class to ensure proactive security without relying on financial indicators (like BTC ransoms) which often appear too late in the attack lifecycle.
